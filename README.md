# **Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul**

Pilgrim is a complete overhaul of Skyrim's religion system that adds dozens of new deities and with powerful shrine effects to the game. It also turns several priests in the hold capitals into vendors who sell thematically appropriate items such as amulets, potions, spells, and scrolls. The priests also offer services such as Cure Disease Potions and scrolls of Divine Intervention.

## **Pilgrims and Cultists**

Pilgrim adds two perks to the game, Pilgrim and Cultist respectively. The Pilgrim perk is in the Restoration tree, and it governs gods such as the Divines, Auriel, and the All-Maker. The Cultist perk is in the Conjuration tree, and it governs gods such the Daedra, Mannimarco, and Sithis.

Both of these perks have two ranks, one at 30 and one at 60 of their respective. The first rank doubles the strength of the relevant shrines. The second rank adds a second, additional bonus that you receive when you are under the effect of the relevant shrines.

## **Prayer**

The first time you pray at a shrine, you will receive a Lesser Power called Prayer. This power will allow you to meditate in order to receive a blessing from the last shrine you prayed at. Prayer works with both Divine and Daedric shrines, and you do not need to have invested in either the Pilgrim or Cultist perks to use it.

Praying in this manner does not cure diseases (in fact, neither does praying at shrines--check the "Priestly Vendors" section for more important on how to cure diseases with this mod).

## **The Shrines**

### **The Divines**

The Divines are the most commonly worshiped gods in the land. They have numerous temples, amulets, and shrines located around the world. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.

### **Other Benevolent Deities**

These deities are worshipped by other cultures not native to Skyrim. Although their worship is less common, it is not usually perceived as malicious. Their shrines are rare, and may be more difficult to find. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.

### Tall Papa and The All-Maker

These two deities are listed separately because they have slightly more complex effects. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.

### **The Daedra and Other Malevolent Deities**

These deities are dark gods whose worship is shunned by polite society. They are, for the most part, Daedric Princes, although a few other malevolent entities are presented here. The powers these gods provide are much more volatile, and extract a great cost from their worshippers. They are governed by the Conjuration perk Cultist.

## **Priestly Vendors**

Pilgrim turns one priest in each of the five major cities into a special class of vendor. These priests will sell a few spell tomes, but more importantly, they will sell healing and defensive items such as potions and scrolls. They will also sell special scrolls of Divine Intervention. These scrolls will allow you to teleport to their respective temples. If you are an Expert or above in Restoration, you will be able to buy a spell of Divine Intervention from each of the five priests, which will allow you to teleport to their temple without consuming an item.

Since shrines no longer cure diseases in Pilgrim, the priests will be sure to stock extra potions of Cure Disease. You may wish to purchase a few before embarking on a long journey.
